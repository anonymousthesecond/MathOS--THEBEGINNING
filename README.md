# MathOS--THEBEGINNING Basic Operating System Kernel Development

This repository contains the source code for a basic operating system kernel under development. It focuses on demonstrating core functionalities like process management and memory management.

**Current State and Limitations:**

* **Early Stage Development:** This code represents an ongoing learning project and is not a production-ready OS.
* **Hardware Dependence:** The code is currently designed for x86 architecture and may require modifications for other platforms.
* **Limited Functionality:** It lacks essential features like a file system, device drivers, and a full user interface.
* **Impractical for Bare Metal:** Running this kernel directly on your computer's hardware is not recommended due to dependencies and missing functionalities.

**Improvements and Future Development:**

* **Memory Management:** The code implements basic memory allocation and requires further development for robust memory protection and paging/segmentation.
* **Process Management:** While process creation and termination are present, context switching and inter-process communication need to be implemented.
* **Advanced Features:** Future goals include a file system, device drivers, and a user interface for a more complete OS experience.

**Testing and Experimentation:**

**Emulators are the recommended approach for testing this kernel due to the limitations mentioned above.** Here are your options:

* **Bochs Emulator:** [https://sourceforge.net/projects/bochs/files/bochs/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bochs/files/bochs/)
* **QEMU Emulator:** [https://www.qemu.org/](https://www.qemu.org/)

These emulators provide a simulated hardware environment where you can run your kernel code and experiment with its functionalities.

**Installation (For Emulated Testing):**

Specific installation instructions will depend on the emulator you choose. Both Bochs and QEMU offer comprehensive documentation for setting up and using their software. 

**Additionally:**

* You will need an x86 assembly language compiler (like NASM) and a linker (like LD) to build the kernel object files.
* Refer to the emulator documentation for instructions on loading custom kernels into the emulated environment.

**Disclaimer:**

Experimenting with kernel development can be complex. While we strive to provide a well-structured codebase, there may be unforeseen issues.  Always proceed with caution and back up your system before attempting to run custom code in emulated environments.
