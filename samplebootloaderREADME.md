## Bootloader for Basic Operating System Kernel Development

This document describes a basic bootloader written in x86 assembly language for use with the provided operating system kernel code. It's designed to function within an emulated environment like Bochs or QEMU.

**Functionality:**

* The bootloader loads the kernel image from a predefined memory location into memory.
* It sets the appropriate segment register for the kernel code.
* The bootloader then transfers control to the kernel's entry point, initiating the kernel execution process.

**Compatibility:**

* This bootloader is primarily compatible with x86 emulated environments offered by Bochs or QEMU.
* It assumes a simple flat memory model within the emulator.  
* To ensure compatibility with your specific setup, you might need to adjust:
    * Memory addresses (where the kernel image is located and where it's loaded)
    * Segment values (depending on your kernel's memory layout)
    * Kernel entry point (if it differs from the beginning of the kernel image)

**Limitations and Improvements:**

* This is a basic bootloader for educational purposes. It lacks features like:
    * Error handling during the loading process
    * Support for more complex memory management schemes
    * Bootloader configuration options
* Here are some potential improvements for future development:
    * Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle potential issues during the loading process.
    * Allow for configuration options to specify the kernel image location and size dynamically.
    * Explore compatibility with more advanced memory management techniques.

**Using the Bootloader:**

1. **Configure your Emulator:**  Refer to your chosen emulator's documentation (Bochs or QEMU) for instructions on setting up the boot process. You'll need to specify the bootloader file and potentially configure the kernel image location within the emulator's memory.
2. **Adjust Bootloader (if needed):**  As mentioned earlier,  review your kernel code's memory layout and entry point.  If necessary, modify the bootloader code to match your specific requirements (refer to the provided comments within the code for guidance).
3. **Test and Refine:**  Test the combination of the bootloader and your kernel code within the emulator.  Make adjustments to the bootloader or your kernel code as needed to achieve successful loading and execution.

**Disclaimer:**

This bootloader is provided as a starting point for educational purposes. It might require adjustments for compatibility with your specific kernel code and emulator environment.  Always proceed with caution when modifying bootloader code, as it plays a crucial role in the system startup process.
