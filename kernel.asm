; Basic kernel with enhanced functionalities (continued)

; Process management variables (enhanced)
mov num_processes, 0     ; Number of running processes
process_table db 10 dup(0) ; Array to store pointers to process structures (up to 10 processes)
current_process dw 0     ; Index of the currently running process

; Process structure (enhanced)
process_struct db
    esp dw 0                ; Process stack pointer
    ebp dw 0                ; Process base pointer
    program_start dw 0       ; Starting address of process code
    data_start dw 0          ; Starting address of process data
    stack_start dw 0          ; Starting address of process stack
    stack_size dw 0          ; Size of the process stack
    memory_limit dw 0        ; Memory limit for the process
    state db 0               ; Process state (e.g., Running, Ready, Terminated)
process_struct ends

; File system variables (memory-based)
mov file_system_start, 0x2000 ; Starting address of memory-based file system

; Data structure for a file in the memory-based file system (no change)

; Keyboard driver (simulated)
; (Replace with real interrupt handling for keyboard input)
mov keyboard_buffer_head dw 0  ; Index of the first character in the keyboard buffer
mov keyboard_buffer_tail dw 0  ; Index of the last character in the keyboard buffer
keyboard_buffer db 16 dup(0)   ; Buffer to store keyboard input (max 16 characters)

read_scancode:
    ; (Simulate reading a scancode from the keyboard)
    mov al, 0x45             ; Simulate a scancode (replace with actual input)
    ret

get_char:
    ; Get a character from the keyboard buffer
    cmp keyboard_buffer_head, keyboard_buffer_tail
    je no_char_available     ; Buffer empty, return error
    mov al, byte ptr [keyboard_buffer + keyboard_buffer_head * 1]
    inc keyboard_buffer_head  ; Update buffer head
    cmp keyboard_buffer_head, 16 ; Check for buffer wrap-around
    je set_buffer_head_to_zero  ; Reset head if it reaches the end
    ret

no_char_available:
    ret -1                   ; Return -1 to indicate no character available

set_buffer_head_to_zero:
    mov keyboard_buffer_head, 0
    ret

; Handle user input (modified)
handle_enter:
    call get_char           ; Get a character from the keyboard (simulated)
    cmp al, -1               ; Check for error (no character available)
    je handle_enter          ; Loop back if no character available
    cmp al, 0x0D             ; Check for enter key

    call print_char          ; Print the entered character
    jmp handle_input         ; Wait for next character

handle_enter:
    ; Parse the command and arguments (simplified)
    ; ... (existing command logic)

; Memory management (improved)
; (Simplified representation, actual implementation would be more complex)

; Memory regions:
; - Kernel memory (fixed)
; - Free memory pool (managed by the kernel)
; - Process memory (allocated for each process)

; allocate_memory: function to allocate memory from the free memory pool
; (replace with a real memory management algorithm)
allocate_memory proc
    ; Search for a large enough contiguous block in the free memory pool
    ; If found, mark the block as allocated and return the starting address
    ; Otherwise, return an error code
    ret
endp allocate_memory

; free_memory: function to free memory allocated to a process
; (replace with a real memory management algorithm)
free_memory proc
    ; Mark the process memory block as free in the free memory pool
    ret
endp free_memory

; System calls (enhanced)
sys_create_process:
    ; (Implement logic to create a new process structure)
    ; Allocate memory for process code, data, and stack using allocate_memory
    ; Set process registers (placeholder for future)
    ; Add the new process to the process table and set state to 'Ready'
    inc num_processes
    ret
